# Web Store

This iteration of the project integrates API support to read in the list of products to be displayed on the store. Sends you to a login page, you click to enter the Store Front, a loader will spin while it fetches API data, and then the product list will display. Includes an image, name, and description for each. Quantities can be adjusted as in previous iterations.

Loader: Vite
Packages: React, react-dom, mapbox-gl
