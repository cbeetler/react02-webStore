This iteration of the project supports API map integration via mapbox-gl. Tweaks were needed to get it running properly on my computer as opposed to the React Tutorial application, but the end result displays a map with Copenhagen set as the default marker.

Loader: Vite
Packages: React, react-dom, mapbox-gl
