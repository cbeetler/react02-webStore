This iteration of the project builds upon map integration via mapbox-gl. Mapbox logic was split into its own component, a custom hook useMapboxMap. When called, the hook will render the map in the container specified in the function parameter.

Caution: This iteration is entirely focused on mapbox integration, there is no display or logic related to other components.

Loader: Vite
Packages: React, react-dom, mapbox-gl
